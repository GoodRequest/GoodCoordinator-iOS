# GoodCoordinator
### ðŸ§­ Programmatic navigation made simple, 100% SwiftUI

In just 3 lines of code
```swift
@Push(makeHome) var home
func makeHome(model: HomeModel) -> HomeView { HomeView(model: model) }

route(to: \.home, HomeModel(username: username, password: password))
```

## Usage

1. <details><summary>Implement a SwiftUI App</summary>
  
   ```swift
   @main struct NavigationApp: App {
       private let coordinator = AppCoordinator(())

       var body: some Scene {
           WindowGroup {
               coordinator.makeView()
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   This is a standard implementation for a 100% SwiftUI app.
   </details>

2. <details><summary>Implement your first coordinator</summary> 
  
   ```swift
   import GoodCoordinator
   
   final class AppCoordinator: NavigationCoordinator {
       typealias Input = Void
       typealias Output = Void
       var state: NavigationStack = .init(debugTitle: "AppCoordinator")

       @Root(makeRoot) var root

       func makeRoot() -> InitialView {
           InitialView() /// SwiftUI View!
       }
   }
   ```

   Don't worry about code you don't understand yet. Feel free to name the `makeRoot`Â function in any way you prefer. The function returns the view of your choice. However, to get this code to compile, you need to do one more thing:
   </details>

3. <details><summary>Modify your SwiftUI View a bit</summary>
  
   ```swift
   import GoodCoordinator
   
   struct InitialView: View, Screen { /// Extend from Screen as well
       ...
   ```
   </details>

4. <details><summary>Add a navigation step</summary>

   ```swift
   @Push(makeNewScreen) var openNewScreen

   func makeNewScreen() -> NewScreen {
       NewScreen(viewModel: NewScreenViewModel())
   }
   ```
   
   Add a step into your coordinator and specify, how the view will get constructed.
   </details>

5. <details><summary>Navigate!</summary>

   ```swift
   @EnvironmentObject var router: Router<AppCoordinator>

   // SwiftUI view code
   Button(action: {
       router.coordinator.route(to: \.openNewScreen)
   }, label: {
       Text("Go to new screen")
   })
   // More SwiftUI view code
   ```
   
   Launch the navigation step from your view.
